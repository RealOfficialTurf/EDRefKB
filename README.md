# EDRefKB

An Elite Dangerous third-party tool that generates visual keyboard reference sheet from Elite Dangerous key bindings, all in one html page!

## How to use

1. Head to the Release page on the sidebar to get the html file.
2. Open the html file in your favorite browser to use.
3. Follow the instructions in the opened page.

Note: Make sure to use the file from the Release page and *not* from this page!

The result will be an image that can saved and used freely.


## Why?

Both [EDBindings](https://github.com/ghorsey/EdBindings) and [EDRefCard](https://github.com/richardbuckle/EDRefCard) are great for generating key bindings reference sheets. However, EDRefCard requires the user to setup a web server in order to run the program (There's a web version [here](https://edrefcard.info/), but what if the servers went offline?), and EDBindings require the user to install a program in their computer. Worse, they lack one thing in common: Graphical representation! Both tools only generate a one long list of keybinds that are hard to read. And so, this tool was made with these in mind.


## Feedbacks and reports, please

This is my first time of actually developing a real usable third-party tool for helping players, so please be gentle to me.

## Plans for the future

- Fixing texts going out of bounds
- Prettier keyboard layout
